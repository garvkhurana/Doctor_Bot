# Doctor_Chatbot

A doctor contacted me for an freelance project but at the end moment he denied to take up the project,I made multiple chatbots through chains,its api and its backend or the client file through which the chatbots will get invoke,used streamlit for the UI and used langchain for the framework,used Ollama model for the text generation.

1st model-Query bot that will take up the query and will answer the following query in medical context.

2nd model-Quick Diffrential diagnosis bot,the user will enter his age,gender,medical history and the medications he is taking and then the query will be answered.

3rd model-Diffrential diagnosis bot,the bot will ask the user and the user will enter his age,gender,medical history and the medications he is taking and through this context the query will be answered.

4th model-Radiologist bot,used LLava model of META here that will analyze the uploaded image and then it will tell that at which part of the uploaded organ the user is facing any disease or that particular organ is healthy.
